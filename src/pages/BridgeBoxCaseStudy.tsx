BridgeBox builds a mobile app for rural residents to call for help during disasters like flash flooding, and a desktop software for "responders" (local governments, nonprofits, and employers) to manage and respond to the submitted cases. The high stakes and unique context for rural Thai users made usability a critical priority for both the mobile and desktop interface.

              <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                Past research and design at BridgeBox relied on surveys and interviews, but these methods often yielded little more than confirmation of expected issues. Participatory approaches were chosen for two key reasons:

              <ol className="list-decimal list-inside text-gray-700 space-y-2 mb-4">
                <li>To gather honest critique despite Thailand's culturally engrained indirect feedback tendencies</li>
                <li>To play to collectivist cultural strengths. Thai social values are heavily focused on building trustworthy relationships and amicable collaboration, making this context a particularly good fit for participatory design workshops</li>

              <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mb-4">Running workshops in rural contexts</h3>
              <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                To achieve the project goals, I planned five participatory design workshops for users in the Songkhla Province, a politically sensitive and flood-prone area. In the first two workshops, I ran while my collaborator from BridgeBox translated - however, we quickly realized that common technology concepts in English often don't have a clear Thai translation. Moreover, my Thai collaborators were interested in learning participatory design, so I decided to take the more intensive process of training Thai collaborators in participatory design, so that they could lead workshop facilitation. By the final workshop, Thai collaborators were comfortable facilitating sessions independently, and since this project's conclusion have continued to do so.
              </p>
              <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                After each workshop, I reflected not only on the product feedback received, but the methodological blockers to a successful session. Through successive rounds of participatory design, I learned that a successful participatory design workshops for rural users with lower technical literacy should include:
              </p>
              <ul className="list-disc list-inside text-gray-700 space-y-3 mb-6">
                <li>Activity instructions that are more detailed than typical, and broken in discrete steps (e.g., "First, write the steps you'd take to report an incident. Then, draw the screen you'd expect to see for each step").</li>
                <li>In-person sessions, as many participants were not comfortable juggling tools like Zoom or online whiteboards. Using familiar materials like pen and paper allowed participants to express their ideas more comfortably. The BridgeBox founder, after co-facilitating, noted "It's important to have someone in the field with participants, because online it's difficult to get their full attention‚Ä¶ in person, you can see the time they spent to write down what they actually think."</li>
                <li>Flexible pacing with respect to Thailand's polychronic view of time, where building consensus matters more than keeping to strict schedules.</li>

              <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                Workshops used generative sketching to invite participants to imagine solutions beyond the existing software. This encouraged participants to propose ideas, compare alternatives, and frame feedback as preferences rather than critiques.
              </p>
              <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                This approach yielded tangible concepts that met real user needs, such as:

              <ul className="list-disc list-inside text-gray-700 space-y-2 mb-6">

                <li>Bridge Alert, a one-way channel for urgent announcements from responders to users.</li>
              </ul>
              <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                Beyond feature improvements, collaborating on the solution garnered buy in from users, with one BridgeBox facilitator noting "[Rural responders] realized that the existing process does not work well and were keen to adopt new tools. With the participatory approach, they take ownership in designing." This buy in is crucial not only for efficient emergency response, but also for BridgeBox itself, who work under immense pressure to scale their solutions quickly amid the dramatic climate changes in Thailand.

              <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                At participatory design workshops, emergency responders often spoke with frustration of trying to correctly sort cases into categories using a complex set of government guidelines. While time consuming for a human, this well defined task would be simple for an AI model. The feature I proposed would auto-suggest tags for submitted cases by category and urgency. Reports that were automatically tagged as urgent, such as "medical emergency" or "human rights violation" could then be prioritized over more routine issues like "documentation approval needed."
              </p>
              <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                Because the BridgeBox team only had one engineer, I volunteered to design this feature and build the model that would power it. The feature's goals were to:

              <ul className="list-disc list-inside text-gray-700 space-y-2 mb-4">
                <li>Auto suggest tags for submitted cases by category and urgency. Reports were automatically tagged by urgency: urgent "medical emergency" or "human rights violation" cases were prioritized over lower-urgency issues like "documentation approval needed."</li>
              </ul>
              <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                First, I designed the flow that would allow users to accept or correct the AI's suggested categories, saving time and creating feedback models where the AI could continually improve its performance with human input. Next, I gathered historical data from BridgeBox cases, with the correct tags for each one based on the handbook. Then, I uploaded the data to &lt;TOOL&gt;, iteratively training and testing the model, until we achieved a satisfactory &lt;name of test&gt;. From here, I passed my work off to the developer for integration.

              Working with BridgeBox, I learned that participatory design ‚Äî carefully adapted for rural, low-digital-literacy users ‚Äî could uncover solutions that were both technically feasible and socially resonant. By involving participants directly in sketching, testing, and decision-making, we not only shaped platform features but also built lasting user trust.

              I was drawn to this collaboration for my Fulbright Fellowship because of the opportunity to work on Smart City tech for frontline communities, who bear the brunt of effects from the climate crisis. My approach to designing disaster response tools is so much more than just building software ‚Äî it's about facilitating trust, participation, and context-sensitive innovation to engrain self-empowered resilience into the communities that need it most.
