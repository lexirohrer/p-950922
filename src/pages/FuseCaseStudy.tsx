                  My biggest project during my summer on the Fuse team was <strong>the start to finish design and testing of a new onboarding sequence.</strong> In past versions of Fuse, there had been no onboarding procedure besides a pop up message encouraging new users to "try capturing and saving content", so this was a first effort at designing an onboarding sequence to introduce users to Fuse.
                </p>
                
                <p className="text-[#403930] text-lg mb-6">
                  To approach this task, I began by researching various styles of onboarding. After reading up on situations where different onboarding strategies were more or less successful, <strong>I thought about situations in which users would be introduced to Fuse.</strong> In comparing my research to the situations in which users would first encounter Fuse, I decided to design a Trello-style onboarding. Trello, a web-based list-making application, onboards users by dropping them into a pre-populated board and allowing them to explore the interface organically.

                  <strong>Overarching themes</strong> included balancing "too much clutter and too little information," user difficulties with organizing information, and the "strategic use of GIFs." The first draft was "information heavy" and "overwhelming the user," while the second draft (without GIFs) left users "at a loss for where to direct their attention." The final design "reimplemented GIFs, but did so more strategically to draw users' attention to certain parts of the screen, moving them through the onboarding project without explicitly using a tooltip sequence."

                  My work with storyboards aimed to explore the link between existing or prospective features and the value they bring to our users. To examine these relationships, I created a series of storyboards detailing common challenges that befall researchers. These storyboards illustrate the way Fuse allows users to tackle challenges using existing features, or how they could do so with prospective features.

                <p className="text-[#403930] text-lg mb-8">
                  After creating these storyboards, I conducted interviews with users to determine whether the problems presented were truly valid and disruptive, and if the proposed solutions were feasible and amenable. After holding these in-person interviews and synthesizing early insights, I designed and ran an online survey to reach a wider audience and learn more in relation to those early insights. Testing with boards showcasing existing features allowed us to discover whether these features were realistically used in the predicted ways. Speaking with users about the value of prospective features allowed us to prioritize these features' development in accordance with real user needs.

                  My interview protocol, <strong>besides a traditional question and answer format, included an observational process walkthrough.</strong> For the process walkthrough, I asked users to take a source they'd saved in Fuse and go through the motions of moving it to a different application. This portion of the interview allowed me to catch parts of the processes the users themselves were unaware of, and therefore couldn't describe.

                  Insights from this particular portion of the interview were so valuable that I decided to capture them in their own document, shown below. This insights document shows synthesized process flows for users methods of getting information out of Fuse. Most notably, these process flows allowed me to emphasize the tediousness of some processes our users were following in my presentation to the team.

                  Although my work with the Fuse team was conducted in an academic research setting, it often felt more like a startup environment with so many opportunities to jump in and lend a hand on many different aspects of the product. In this setting, I learned several meaningful takeaways that I know will allow me to better navigate future work environments and contribute to those projects with competence.

                      In many of my collaborative projects for school, I worked with solely UX designers to create a final prototype that could theoretically be passed on to a development team. With Fuse, our designers and developers were exchanging information daily, and using feedback from each other to iteratively improve our work. With this structure, I grew to understand that the pure version of the User Centered Design process that my schooling has hammered into me isn't realistically implementable, but that incorporating the key elements of that process is still valuable.

                      Although I've encountered the mantra "you are not the user" in the UX community time and time again, in this case those of us creating the tool actually were the users. Fuse began as a tool to help academic researchers ‚Äî those who make up the team working on Fuse ‚Äî and grew into a tool for more general purpose research. This situation made it tempting at times to rely on assumptions drawn from our own habits, and sidestep time consuming user research showing how others do things differently. Rather than relying on our conceptions of "I do it this way and I'm a researcher, so all our researcher users must do it in this way", I made a concerted effort advocate for user research that ensured our product was accessible for a wide range of user workflows.

                      As someone who really likes feedback, adjusting to an industry-like position without grading, peer reviews, and teacher comments was initially difficult. Throughout the course of the internship, I learned to feel out a balance between soliciting valuable feedback while respecting my coworkers' and supervisor's time. In communicating shared goals and articulating prospective projects in multiple ways, I also learned firsthand the value of ensuring that everyone is on the same page before moving forward with a project. In particular, honing this strategy allowed me to solicit meaningful feedback throughout the life cycle of each project and feel more confident about my work's value.
